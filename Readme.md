# Introduction
Documentation based on markdown files purposefully written for this site and imported from git repositories.<br /><br />
Work in progress...
## Todo
- Add docs configuration to repositories to customize view
- Fix casing for readme files in different formats
- Refactor documentation so it doesn't look too shitty
- Add yaml library for writing mkdocs.yml file instead of appending
- Support categories in docs configuration
## Done
- Add dispatch triggers to build automatically when files update in a repository
- Add files from GitHub to the site when building
- Find fix for links that point to placeholders
- Add crontimer for docs build
